Iron Games Project Scope

Intro

The Iron Games company is interested in the field of strategy mobile games, a sector that is expected to duplicate its value in the next 10 years. Unfortunately, the company does not have produced any game within this genre to get data. With that in mind, the head of the Data Analysis department of Iron Games, suggested analyzing the 11 years old game Forge of Empires, due to his solid presence in the global market. 


Proposition: 
In order to invest in this genre of games, the company is interested to know better the segment: The customer, the potential income, the elements of the game

Main question: Is it worth investing in this field?

- Do the users of Forge of Empires (FoE) follow the Pareto Principle, where 20% of the active members spend in the game. 
- Does this game have a base known by whales, that represent the 2% to 5% bigger spenders, who usually spend significant amounts.
- Can we have some insights about players segmentation:
 Which are the main reasons for players to spend: competition, exclusive buildings, game progress and new content? 
Can we affirm that players that are not leaders in real life, but are leaders in the game, tend to spend more?
What is the demographic distribution of the users: Age, income and country.


Data collection:
For this study we are going to apply a survey on players based in the FoE international server. This place gathers players with a wide variety of styles, from all around the globe, which reduces the chance of bias on our findings. 

The survey has 10 close-ended questions.

Hypotheses: 
	These are the hypotheses that we would like to test:

The income comes from 20% of the users.

The higher spenders represent up to 5% of the payers. 

Newer players (up to 1 year playing) tend to spend higher amounts than long term players: 
Assumption: experienced players know more about the game and are more aware about the ways to get items for free.

Spending money increase the longevity of a player
Assumption: Players that invested time and money in the game as less likely to give up and throw the investment away. 

Competitive players spend more than active players but non-competitive.
Assumption: Players who invested time and money in the game are less likely to give up and throw the investment away. 

Competitive players spend more than active players but non-competitive.
Assumption: There are global and event related rankings that have no impact on game progress, but demand a higher spending of diamonds for being competitive. (this hypothesis I can cross with player style and main purpose of spending).

Players who are not leaders in real life but lead on the game, tend to spend more.
Assumption: The game might raise the feeling of importance on players that have followers and are seen as reference inside the game, but not in real life. The need for a powerful city to sustain this position might demand more purchases.
